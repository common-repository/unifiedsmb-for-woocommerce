## Purpose and Functionality

UnifiedSMB for WooCommerce integrates with UnifiedSMB Backoffice, a third-party service, to enhance your e-commerce capabilities.
This integration allows for seamless synchronization of your WooCommerce product catalog, customer data, orders, and payment processing with the UnifiedSMB platform.

- **Product Catalog Synchronization:** Your WooCommerce store is automatically updated with product information from the UnifiedSMB Backoffice, ensuring your product listings are always up-to-date.
- **Customer and Order Synchronization:** Customer information and order details are synced between WooCommerce and the UnifiedSMB Backoffice, providing a unified view of your customer interactions and sales.
- **Payment Processing:** The plugin handles online payments through the UnifiedSMB payment platform, offering a secure and efficient checkout process for your customers.

## UnifiedSMB Backoffice Access

Each user of UnifiedSMB for WooCommerce will have a unique URL to access their specific **UnifiedSMB Backoffice**.
This URL follows a standard format:

``
https://unifiedsmb.[YourBackofficePrefix].techdogcloud.com/
``

Replace `[YourBackofficePrefix]` with your personalized backoffice **prefix provided by UnifiedSMB**.
If you are unsure of your backoffice prefix, please refer to your UnifiedSMB account setup information or contact UnifiedSMB support for assistance.

## Additional Third-Party Service Usage

Our plugin integrates with an external service known as the SalesChannels API to enhance its functionality and provide you with an advanced e-commerce experience.
